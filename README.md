# drumKit
Heya!
Here I have attempted to create a drumkit website while learning the DOM (document object model) in JavaScript. 
There are two ways to play the drum, viz.,
  1. by mouseclick
  2. by keyboard press
It seemed as a simple yet elegant way of executing what you have learnt so far.

Thanks!
